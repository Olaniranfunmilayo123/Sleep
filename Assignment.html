<p>Sleep occurs in <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_cycle" target="_blank">naturally</a>repeating periods</a>, in which the body alternates between two distinct modes: <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep" target = "blank">REM</a>sleep and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-rapid_eye_movement_sleep" target="blank">non-REM sleep.</a> Although REM stands for "rapid eye movement", this mode of sleep has many other aspects, including virtual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralysis" target = _blank">paralysis</a> of the body. A well-known feature of sleep is the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream" target = "_blank">Dream</a> an experience typically recounted in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative" target = "_blankk">Narrative</a> form, which resembles waking life while in progress, but which usually can later be distinguished as fantasy. During sleep, most of the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body" target ="_blank">body's systems</a> are in an <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolichttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolic" target = "_blank">anabolic state,</a> helping to restore the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)" target = "_blank">immune,</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system" target = "_blank">Nervous</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system" target = "_blank">Skeletal</a>  and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system" target = "_blank"> muscular systems;</a>[3] these are vital processes that maintain mood, memory, and cognitive function, and play a large role in the function of the <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_cycle" target="blank">endocrine</a> and <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_cycle" target="blank">immune systems.</a>[4] The internal <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_cycle" target="_blank">circadian</a>  clock promotes sleep daily at night. The diverse purposes and mechanisms of sleep are the subject of substantial ongoing research.[5] Sleep is a highly <a href ="Assignment.html" target = "_blank">Conserved</a>behavior across animal evolution.[6]</p>
<p>Humans may suffer from various <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-rapid_eye_movement_sleep" target="_blank">sleep disorder</a>, including <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-rapid_eye_movement_sleep" target="_blank">dyssomnias</a> such as <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_cycle" target="_blank">insomnia</a> <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_cycle" target="_blank">hypersomnia</a>, <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_cycle" target="_blank">Nacrolepsy</a>, and <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_cycle" target="_blank">sleep apnea</a>; <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_cycle" target="_blank">parasomias</a> such as <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_cycle" target="_blank">Sleep walking</a> and <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_cycle" target="_blank">rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder</a>;  <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_cycle" target="_blank">bruxism</a>; and  <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_cycle" target="_blank">circadian rhythm sleep disorders</a>. The use of <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolichttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolic" target = "_blank">Artificcial light</a>has substantially altered humanity's sleep patterns.[7]</p>
